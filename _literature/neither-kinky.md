<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Top 10 tips that your high school sex-ed teacher does not want you to know </h1>
<p  markdown="1">
**1.** <br>
**2.** Let it become a non-routinary routine. Wear different kinds of hats. Eat different kinds of fruit. Leave windows more or less open each time. <br>
**3.** It's okay if you need a lot of foreplay. A good rule of thumb is that six weeks should be enough. <br>
**4.** Build a treehouse. It's more fun as an adult than it ever was as a kid. <br>
**5.** Strip first, tease later. <br>
**6.** Nice. <br>
**7.** Get high as a kite and count how many stars would fit in your pockets. Take picnics at Betelgeuse, Sirius and Alpha Centauri, and focus on how touch is affected by the differences in gravity and pressure. Make sure you're both fully naked before completing the previous steps. <br>
**8.** Use Google calendar and schedule at least one session a week. Solo hiking is also fun, just be careful. <br>
**9.** Go to 6 only when running short on time. Taking turns is almost always better. <br>
**X.** Be generous. Treat others 25% better than the way you want to be treated. <br>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Unprotected sex</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">

Guys literally only want one thing and it's fucking disgusting. They want to do it with their hearts unwrapped, in full contact; give and take.
Do you have any sexual fantasies?
I sometimes imagine I wake up with my legs intertwined with someone's leg, an arm around me, and all of a sudden don't feel like running away.
I want to stay and have breakfast, and make arepas that are so round the entire world fits inside them.
When you eat them a piece of Antartica gets stuck in your teeth.
We can go brush together so kisses taste better, and we remember the whole world is in our stomachs, and laundry is fun to do once again.
The world is our backyard and the washing machine is now our bed.
