<p class="poem">
Where do words go when they're lost in translation?
where is Go going after the tip of your tongue?
what is that Why is so curious about?
how comes that Whisper is stronger than Shout?

words also get in trouble, as some of us do
I is jealous of the O's in Voodoo

shut up you thin bastard, all Mississippi is for you!

some are not subtle, you've heard it too
like the repeated affair that Fuck has with You

there are also some folks who Seldom appear
or only in formal parties like Regards and Dear
doppelg√§ngers as well, look at Close and Near
famous singers too, we have Crystal Clear

Based and Cringe just rose to fame
others like Thou have gotten tame
want to see words just go insane? let me give you a dose
the fashion show is at Verse
the big party is at Prose

Serendipity is a model of the highest couture
Love is praised when coupling with Pure
some words are shamed like Moisty and Gross
and Dictionary is trashed on as the big know-it-all

Read and Read are twins of different sound
Poetry is always there for Attention
Syntax always complains that she's bored
at the top of ship Language the crew gathers around
<i>"today is the day we get rid of quotations!"</i>
and they made poor Quotations jump off of the board

this is what happens when books get closed
stories likes these we could go all night long
wonders of the logocentric World of Words
</p> 

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Minor post-climax reflection</h1>

<p style="white-space: pre; text-align:center;">
are letters alive or just limbs of words?
and what about sentences
cause it seems to me that
there's more in Hide And Seek
than in Hide and in Seek
and those three little words
go beyond the threesome of You and I and Love

what is it then?
what is It then?

are there any wowords that words can use to talk?
</p>
