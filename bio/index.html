          <article>
            <p>I was thrown into the world the Tuesday 21<sup>st</sup> of November of 1995, in Santiago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chile</a>. As a result, my native language is Spanish, my nationality is Chilean, my favorite comedian is <a href="https://www.felipeavello.cl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Felipe Avello</a>, and my favorite liquor is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisco" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pisco</a>. Also I forgot to mention that I was born as a member of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most abundant and widespread species of primate</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>I grew up in Santiago, where I first attended the German school <a href="https://dsmorus.cl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deustche Schule Sankt Thomas Morus</a>. Because of how poorly I was doing at school (my German was terrible, and I had troubles with other kids), my parents helped me transfer to the Catholic school <a href="https://www.colegiosanfranciscodeasis.cl/csfda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colegio San Francisco de Asis</a>. After a first year where I also did poorly and got complains about my behavior, the next year everything changed. I became a Catholic, and for the first time started doing well academically and making good friends (I still talk to many of them today, and I love them!). As time went by, I went more and more into Catholicism, until the point of considering priesthood. Fortunately, I started being mentored by the amazing Chilean philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Torretti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Roberto Torretti</a>, from whom I basically learned all the philosophy I know today. He would suggest a book for me to read, and we would discuss it. This way, I read most of Plato, Aristotle, Leibniz, Spinoza, Hume, Kant, and others. The result of this process made me an atheist, and also oriented me towards the political left-wing.</p>

<p>In my last year of high school our math teacher (thanks for everything Álvaro Sánchez!) invited 3 students to enroll for a robotics competition. Vicente Méndez (who is now a Geologist getting his Masters of Science, the most lucrative career in Chile given its prominent mining industry), Felipe Vergara (who is now a priest!), Eugenio Voticky (who is now a lawyer) and Bernardo Subercaseaux (who is me). We didn’t know anything about robotics; there was no robotics lab in our school, we barely knew some trigonometry, and had learned how to use a soldering iron to build little metallic cubic houses. None of us knew any coding whatsoever. I didn’t even know what “coding” was. I had never talked with a computer scientist. But in a surprising turn of events we went there and won the 1<sup>st</sup> place amongst all schools of Santiago (an 8 million people city!).</p>

</figure>

<p>I started college at the #1 university in Chile, <em><a href="https://portaluchile.uchile.cl/english" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> University of Chile </a></em> (note how creative Chilean university naming is!), where I completely fell in love with Mathematics and Computer Science since my first semester. There I started being mentored by an amazing duo of young professors: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9OH3PokAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pablo Barceló</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a6lUuiwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jorge Pérez</a>.</p>

<p>Professor Jorge Pérez invited me to participate in <em>Competitive Programming</em> (i.e., solve as many algorithmic problems you can in a given period of time) since my first semester, and without any programming knowledge I started to compete, mostly contributing to my team from the mathematical side. So in that first semester, my team composed of 3 freshmen got the 3<sup>rd</sup> place in the National finals. Next year, we also participated and also got the 3<sup>rd</sup> place nation-wide.</p>

</figure>

<p>After 3 semesters, I was selected to participate in a <em>dual-degree</em> program in Paris, France. Moreover, I was the only Chilean of that year in getting the prestigious  <em><a href="https://www.campusfrance.org/en/eiffel-scholarship-program-of-excellence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eiffel Scholarship</a></em>, which supported elite international students to study in France. A very minor setback was caused by the fact that I didn’t know absolutely any French!</p>

</figure>

<p>But I learned French, and many other things too, graduating with two bachelors and two master degrees, one from University of Chile and the other one from <em><a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CentraleSupélec</a></em> (former <em>École Centrale Paris</em>).</p>

<p>Before graduating, I had to come back to Chile, take a few classes and do a master thesis. That’s how the French-Chilean dual-degree was structured. So I went back, and I wanted something better than a 3<sup>rd</sup> place in Competitive Programming. The problem is, ACM-ICPC competitions are limited by age, so I basically had my last opportunity to make it. Fortunately things turn out in my favor, and with a new team I got the 1<sup>st</sup> place in the TCP (Chilean Programming Tournament) twice in a row, while also winning the 1<sup>st</sup> place in Chile at the ACM-ICPC South American Finals. Also, that same year, we participated in the IEEEXtreme 12.0 and got the 29<sup>th</sup> place <strong>worldwide</strong>. Here are some pictures.</p>

<p>For my Chilean master thesis I worked with my mentors Pablo Barceló and Jorge Pérez on theoretical aspects of <em><a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning interpretability.</a></em> 
My thesis obtained the maximum possible score, which implied the especial distinction that my grades will be overridden to make me graduate with a perfect GPA (7.0 in the Chilean scale). This thesis work <a href="https://portaluchile.uchile.cl/noticias/181898/estudiante-de-postgrado-dcc-gana-concurso-de-tesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> won the 1<sup>st</sup> prize in the Latin American contest for master theses in Artificial Intelligence</a>, and resulted in 5 different papers at NeurIPS, a top conference in Machine Learning. One of these papers got distinguished as a <em>spotlight paper</em>, for being amongst the top 3% of the submissions that year.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I did an internship at Facebook (now Meta), on the Oculus organization. I received great guidance (yet not absent of conflicts) from Mahdi Rahimi, and got a juicy return offer from Facebook to come back as a full time Software Engineer.</p>

<p>However, I wanted something more juicy than money: Math. So I enrolled in grad-school at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in August 2021, co-advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anupamg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anupam Gupta</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mheule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marijn Heule</a>. I had an amazing first year in Pittsburgh, doing research, meeting new friends, and struggling through my coldest winter so far!</p>

<p>On September 2022, I moved to Berkeley, California to participate in a program at the <em><a href="">Simons Institute</a></em> (UC 
Berkeley). 
After that time, I was struggling with having two different advisors with two completely disjoint projects, so I acknowledged the old bible verse: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_6:24#:~:text=%E2%80%9CNo%20one%20can%20serve%20two,other." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“No one can serve two masters”</a></em>, and Anupam and I decided to become simply collaborators, while I am now solely advised by Marijn Heule.</p>

<p>We have arrived to the present tense, so the rest is to be written in the <em><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Meatverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meatverse</a></em> first.</p>
