 I'm a second year CS PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I am advised by the amazing <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mheule/">Marijn Heule</a>.
 For a more detailed biography of myself you can click <a href="www.nada.cl">here</a>.
<!--
 Before that, I had the fortune of doing my masters under the greats <a href="https://pbarcelo.ing.uc.cl/">Pablo Barcel√≥</a> and <a href="https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~jperez/">Jorge P√©rez</a>, on theoretical aspects of <i>interpretability in Machine Learning</i>. Even before that, I got engineering degrees from <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/"> CentraleSup√©lec (√âcole Centrale Paris)</a> , and <a href="http://ingenieria.uchile.cl/">University of Chile</a>.

<b>Research statement:</b> I am passionate about several topics in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science. At the highest level, I want to understand more about the limits of formal systems, or in other words, _what can and cannot be done by a computer_. As a consequence, I am interested both in upper and lower bounds for the complexity of problems, and in the tools that allow us to improve bounds.
<!--
    in different parameterizations that attempt to capture what makes a given problem hard. <!--, and in what can be expressed within the limits of simple logical languages. --> 
More concretely, I have been mostly working on:
<ul class="starlist">
<li> Applying automated reasoning to problems in discrete mathematics. </li>
<li> Understanding the impact of partially accurate advice for solving algorithmic problems. </li>
<li> Understanding Machine Learning interpretability from a formal theoretical standpoint. </li>
</ul>
<!--
More in general, I'm a [human being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human), born and raised in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper), who is interested in all sorts of things. My academic interests usually revolve around algorithms, complexity and logic. Some of my non-academic interests are non-human animals ([monkeys](https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/01/14/11/newFile-9.jpg?width=990&auto=webp&quality=75) are my faves!), brewing beer, dancing salsa, playing sports, [writing poetry or short stories](https://bsub.cl/escritos/), languages (üá™üá∏üá∫üá∏üá´üá∑), and philosophy.
