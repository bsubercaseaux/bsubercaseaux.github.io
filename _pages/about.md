 I'm a first year CS PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I am co-advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anupamg/">Anupam Gupta</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mheule/">Marijn Heule</a>. Before that, I had the fortune of doing my masters under the greats <a href="https://pbarcelo.ing.uc.cl/">Pablo Barceló</a> and <a href="https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~jperez/">Jorge Pérez</a>, on theoretical aspects of <i>interpretability in Machine Learning</i>. Even before that, I got engineering degrees from <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/"> CentraleSupélec (École Centrale Paris)</a> , and <a href="http://ingenieria.uchile.cl/">University of Chile</a>.

**Research:** At a very high level, I want to understand more about the limits of formal systems, or in other words, _what can and cannot be done by a computer_. As a consequence, I am interested both in upper and lower bounds for the complexity of different problems, in different parameterizations that attempt to capture what makes a given problem hard, and in what can be expressed within the limits of simple logical languages. Recently, I have become interested in how automated reasoning can be used to help us deal with these questions as well as with other problems in combinatorics.

More in general, I'm a [human being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human), born and raised in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper), who is interested in all sorts of things. My academic interests usually revolve around algorithms, complexity and logic. Some of my non-academic interests are non-human animals ([monkeys](https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/01/14/11/newFile-9.jpg?width=990&auto=webp&quality=75) are my faves!), brewing beer, dancing salsa, playing sports, [writing poetry or short stories](https://bsub.cl/escritos/), languages (🇪🇸🇺🇸🇫🇷), and philosophy.
