I am a 2<sup>nd</sup> year Computer Science PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/">CMU</a>, where I'm advised by the amazing <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mheule/">Marijn Heule</a>.
 For a more detailed biography of myself you can click <a href="bio/">here</a>.
<!--
 Before that, I had the fortune of doing my masters under the greats <a href="https://pbarcelo.ing.uc.cl/">Pablo Barcel√≥</a> and <a href="https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~jperez/">Jorge P√©rez</a>, on theoretical aspects of <i>interpretability in Machine Learning</i>. Even before that, I got engineering degrees from <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/"> CentraleSup√©lec (√âcole Centrale Paris)</a> , and <a href="http://ingenieria.uchile.cl/">University of Chile</a>.

<strong style="font-weight:800;">  Research statement. </strong>
I am passionate about several topics in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science. At the highest level, I want to understand more about the limits of formal systems; _what can and cannot be done (efficiently?) by a computer_. Fortunately, computer scientists have come up with a wide variety of angles from which to attack this broad question. So far, my work can be clustered around the following sub-areas: 
<!--
    in different parameterizations that attempt to capture what makes a given problem hard. <!--, and in what can be expressed within the limits of simple logical languages. --> 
<ul class="starlist">
<li> Automated reasoning applied to problems in discrete mathematics. </li>
<u>Example</u>: <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.09757.pdf">The Packing Chromatic Number of the Infinite Square Grid is 15.</a></em>
<li> Understanding the impact of partially accurate advice for solving algorithmic problems. </li>
<u>Example</u>: <em><a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HFkxZ_V0sBQ">Augmenting Online Algorithms with ùõÜ-accurate predictions.</a></em>
<li> Machine Learning interpretability from a formal theoretical standpoint. </li>
<u>Example</u>: <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12213">On Computing Probabilistic Explanations for Decision Trees.</a></em>
</ul>

More in general, I'm a [human being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human), born and raised in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper), who is interested in all sorts of things. My academic interests usually revolve around algorithms, complexity and logic. Some of my non-academic interests are non-human animals ([monkeys](https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/01/14/11/newFile-9.jpg?width=990&auto=webp&quality=75) are my faves!), brewing beer, dancing salsa, playing sports, [writing poetry or short stories](https://bsub.cl/escritos/), languages (üá™üá∏üá∫üá∏üá´üá∑), and philosophy.

<strong style="font-weight:800;"> Social statement. </strong>
I deeply believe that Math and CS are some of the most beautiful collective enterprises of humankind. Understanding Math and CS as human activities that take place inside of human communities is crucial for me, and therefore I am committed to contributing to their social aspects as well. As a consequence, I am very interested in: peer review, philosophy of science, DEI efforts, and understanding the experiences and perspectives of other scientists, especially those coming from marginalized backgrounds. In particular, a long term goal of mine is to contribute to the development of the theoretical CS community in Chile and South America. If you are interested in my research, or discussing about anything else mentioned here, please reach out to me!
