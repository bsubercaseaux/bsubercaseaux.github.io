Here's a collection of some small websites I've built (some with help of others):
<ul class="starlist">
<li> <a href="https://twentyfour.surge.sh">twentyfour.surge.sh/</a>: A website to play the game of 24.
</li>
<li> <a href="https://packit.surge.sh/"> packit.surge.sh/</a>: A website to play PackIt! (analyzed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12195">our paper</a>).
</li>
<li> <a href="https://k-hole-tester.surge.sh/">k-hole-tester.surge.sh/</a>: A website to test constructions in geometric Ramsey Theory. See e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00737">this paper</a>.
</li>
</ul>
