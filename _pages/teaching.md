I really really really love teaching. So far, I have TA'ed for the following classes:

- Advanced Algorithms (3 times) (University of Chile)
- Undergraduate Algorithms (University of Chile)
- Discrete Math (3 times) (University of Chile)
- Programming Languages (University of Chile)
- Computability and Computational Complexity (University of Chile)
- Computational Complexity (PUC Chile)
- Databases (Ã‰cole Centrale Paris)
- Workshop of Competitive Programming (University of Chile)
- Introduction to Algebra (University of Chile)
- Automata Theory and Formal Languages (University of Chile)

I also had a YouTube channel with math videos, and have collected a fair bit of teaching materials over the years. I plan to upload most of that here. Unfortunately, most of it was originally written in Spanish, so I'll be slowly translating it over time.
