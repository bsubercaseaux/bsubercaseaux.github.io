  abstract    = {In spite of several claims stating that some models are more interpretable than others -- e.g., "linear models are more interpretable than deep neural networks" -- we still lack a principled notion of interpretability to formally compare among different classes of models. We make a step towards such a notion by studying whether folklore interpretability claims have a correlate in terms of computational complexity theory. We focus on local post-hoc explainability queries that, intuitively, attempt to answer why individual inputs are classified in a certain way by a given model. In a nutshell, we say that a class \mathcal{C}_1 of models is more interpretable than another class \mathcal{C}_2, if the computational complexity of answering post-hoc queries for models in \mathcal{C}_2 is higher than for those in \mathcal{C}_1. We prove that this notion provides a good theoretical counterpart to current beliefs on the interpretability of models; in particular, we show that under our definition and assuming standard complexity-theoretical assumptions (such as P\neqNP), both linear and tree-based models are strictly more interpretable than neural networks. Our complexity analysis, however, does not provide a clear-cut difference between linear and tree-based models, as we obtain different results depending on the particular post-hoc explanations considered. Finally, by applying a finer complexity analysis based on parameterized complexity, we are able to prove a theoretical result suggesting that shallow neural networks are more interpretable than deeper ones.},

  title       = {Toward Optimal Radio Colorings of Hypercubes via SAT-solving},
  abstract    = {Radio 2-colorings of graphs are a generalization of vertex colorings motivated by the problem of assigning frequency channels in radio networks. In a radio 2-coloring of a graph, vertices are assigned integer colors so that the color of two vertices u and v differ by at least 2 if u and v are neighbors, and by at least 1 if u and v have a common neighbor. Our work improves the best-known bounds for optimal radio 2-colorings of small hypercube graphs, a combinatorial problem that has received significant attention in the past. We do so by using automated reasoning techniques such as symmetry breaking and Cube and Conquer, obtaining that for n = 7 and n = 8, the coding-theory upper bounds of Whittlesey et al. (1995) are not tight. Moreover, we prove the answer for n=7 to be either 12 or 13, thus making a substantial step towards answering an open problem by Knuth (2015). Finally, we include several combinatorial observations that might be useful for further progress, while also arguing that fully determining the answer for n=7 will require new techniques.},

  title = {Sometimes Hoarding is Harder than Cleaning: NP-hardness of Maximum Blocked-Clause Addition},
  abstract = {Adding blocked clauses to a CNF formula can substantially speed up SAT-solving, both in theory and practice. In theory, the addition of blocked clauses can exponentially reduce the length of the shortest refutation for a formula (Kullman, 1999). In practice, it has been recently shown that the runtime of CDCL solvers decreases significantly for certain instance families when blocked clauses are added as a preprocessing step. This fact is in contrast to, but not in contradiction with, prior results showing that Blocked-Clause Elimination (BCE) is sometimes an effective preprocessing. We suggest that the practical role of blocked clauses in SAT-solving might be richer than expected.
Concretely, we propose a theoretical study of the complexity of Blocked-Clause Addition (BCA) as a preprocessing step for SAT-solving, and in particular, consider the problem of adding the maximum number of blocked clauses of a given arity k to an input formula F. While BCE is a confluent process, meaning that the order in which blocked clauses are eliminated is irrelevant, this is not the case for BCA: adding a blocked clause to a formula might "unblock" a different clause that was previously blocked. This order sensitivity turns out to be a crucial obstacle for carrying out BCA efficiently as a preprocessing step.
Our main result is that computing the maximum number of k-ary blocked clauses that can be added to an input formula F is NP-hard for every k >= 2.},

  abstract    = {A packing $k$-coloring is a natural variation on the standard notion of graph $k$-coloring, where vertices are assigned numbers from $\{1, \ldots, k\}$, and any two vertices assigned a common color $c \in \{1, \ldots, k\}$ need to be at a distance greater than $c$ (as opposed to 1, in standard graph colorings). Despite a sequence of incremental work, determining the packing chromatic number of the infinite square grid has remained an open problem since its introduction in 2002. We culminate the search by proving this number to be 15. We achieve this result by improving the best-known method for this problem by roughly two orders of magnitude. The most important technique to boost performance is a novel, surprisingly effective propositional encoding for packing colorings. Additionally, we developed an alternative symmetry-breaking method. Since both new techniques are more complex than existing techniques for this problem, a verified approach is required to trust them. We include both techniques in a proof of unsatisfiability, reducing the trusted core to the correctness of the direct encoding.},

@article{bps2020,
  abstract    = {Despite the growing interest in interpretability for machine learning models, there
                 seems to be a gap between the world of researchers and that of practitioners and
                 data scientists. Declarative languages, tailored for interactive interpretability and
                 bias detection of models, could be a step towards shortening such a gap. Based
                 on requirements often posed over interpretability tasks, it is desirable for such
                 languages to be interactive, model agnostic, faithful to the models, and have
                 clear and well-understood semantics and complexity. A reasonable way to meet
                 several of these requirements is by having a language strongly rooted in logic. As
                 a first step towards the design of such language, we study how interpretability
                 and bias detection queries can be expressed in first-order logic (FO) --arguably,
                 one of the most prominent logics in different areas of computer science-- over a
                 suitable encoding of machine learning models. We then study the computational
                 complexity of evaluating FO formulae over linear-based, tree-based and deep
                 models. Evaluation is shown to be easier for decision trees and perceptrons than
                 it is for deep neural networks, which seems validated by folklore assumptions
                 of the field. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to the underlying logical
                 structure and how they enhance expressiveness, as well as possible directions
                 towards tractability.},

  abstract    = {We study the expressive power of the LARA language -- a recently proposed unified model for expressing relational and linear algebra operations -- both in terms of traditional database query languages and some analytic tasks often performed in machine learning pipelines. We start by showing LARA to be expressive complete with respect to first-order logic with aggregation. Since LARA is parameterized by a set of user-defined functions which allow to transform values in tables, the exact expressive power of the language depends on how these functions are defined. We distinguish two main cases depending on the level of genericity queries are enforced to satisfy. Under strong genericity assumptions the language cannot express matrix convolution, a very important operation in current machine learning operations. This language is also local, and thus cannot express operations such as matrix inverse that exhibit a recursive behavior. For expressing convolution, one can relax the genericity requirement by adding an underlying linear order on the domain. This, however, destroys locality and turns the expressive power of the language much more difficult to understand. In particular, although under complexity assumptions the resulting language can still not express matrix inverse, a proof of this fact without such assumptions seems challenging to obtain.},

  abstract    = {Formal XAI (explainable AI) is a growing area that focuses on computing explanations with mathematical guarantees for the decisions made by ML models. Inside formal XAI, one of the most studied cases is that of explaining the choices taken by decision trees, as they are traditionally deemed as one of the most interpretable classes of models. Recent work has focused on studying the computation of sufficient reasons, a kind of explanation in which given a decision tree $T$ and an instance $x$, one explains the decision $T(x)$ by providing a subset $y$ of the features of $x$ such that for any other instance $z$ compatible with $y$, it holds that  $T(z) = T(x)$, intuitively meaning that the features in $y$ are already enough to fully justify the classification of $x$ by $T$. 
                 It has been argued, however, that sufficient reasons constitute a restrictive notion of explanation. For such a reason, the community has started to study their probabilistic counterpart, in which one requires that the probability of $T(z) = T(x)$ must be at least some value $\delta \in (0, 1]$, where $z$ is a random instance that is compatible with $y$. Our paper settles the computational complexity of $\delta$-sufficient-reasons over decision trees, showing that both (1) finding $\delta$-sufficient-reasons  that are minimal in size, and (2) finding $\delta$-sufficient-reasons that are minimal inclusion-wise, do not admit polynomial-time algorithms (unless P = NP).
                 This is in stark contrast with the deterministic case ($\delta = 1$) where inclusion-wise minimal sufficient-reasons are easy to compute. By doing this, we answer two open problems originally raised by Izza et al., and extend the hardness of explanations for Boolean circuits presented by W{\"a}ldchen et al. to the more restricted case of decision trees. On the positive side, we identify structural restrictions of decision trees that make the problem tractable, and show how SAT solvers might be able to tackle these problems in practical settings.},

We show that even with predictions that are accurate with a small probability and arbitrarily inaccurate otherwise, we can dramatically outperform worst-case bounds for a range of classical online problems including caching, online set cover, and online facility location.

In the Evil Hangman variant, the setter can change the secret word during the game, as long as the new choice is consistent with the information already given to the guesser. We show that a greedy strategy for Evil Hangman can perform arbitrarily far from optimal, and most importantly, that playing optimally as an Evil Hangman setter is computationally difficult. The latter result holds even assuming perfect knowledge of the language, for several classes of languages, ranging from Finite to Turing Computable.

Although they provide a flexible way of storing and accessing data, they often expose too many low-level details that may result in error prone code that is difficult to maintain and extend. Abstracting low-level functionalities into high-level operators in the form of a query language is a task in which the Data Management community has extensive experience. It is thus important to understand how such an experience can be applied in the design of useful languages for tensor manipulation. In this short paper we study a matrix and a tensor query language that have been recently proposed in the database literature. We show, by using examples, how these proposals are in line with the practical interest in rethinking tensor abstractions. On the technical side, we compare the two languages in terms of operators that naturally arise in Machine Learning pipelines, such as convolution, matrix-inverse, and Einstein summation. We hope our results to provide a theoretical kick-off for the discussion on the design of core declarative query languages for tensors.},

  abstract      = {Several queries and scores have been proposed to explain individual predictions
                   made by ML models. Examples include queries based on ``anchors", which are
                   parts of an instance that are sufficient to justify its classification, and ''feature perturbation" scores such as SHAP. 
                   Given the need for flexible, reliable, and easy-to-apply interpretability methods for ML models, we foresee the need for developing declarative languages to naturally specify different explainability queries. We
                   do this in a principled way by rooting such a language in a logic called FOIL,
                   that allows for expressing many simple but important explainability queries, and
                   might serve as a core for more expressive interpretability languages. We study the

                   to be easily interpretable: decision trees and more general decision diagrams. Since
                   the number of possible inputs for an ML model is exponential in its dimension,
                   tractability of the FOIL evaluation problem is delicate, but can be achieved by either
                   restricting the structure of the models, or the fragment of FOIL being evaluated.
                   We also present a prototype implementation of FOIL wrapped in a high-level
                   declarative language, and perform experiments showing that such a language can

  abstract    = {Wordle is a single-player word-guessing game where the goal is to discover a secret word w that has been chosen from a dictionary D. In order to discover w, the player can make at most 𝓁 guesses, which must also be words from D, all words in D having the same length k. After each guess, the player is notified of the positions in which their guess matches the secret word, as well as letters in the guess that appear in the secret word in a different position. We study the game of Wordle from a complexity perspective, proving NP-hardness of its natural formalization: to decide given a dictionary D and an integer 𝓁 if the player can guarantee to discover the secret word within 𝓁 guesses. Moreover, we prove that hardness holds even over instances where words have length k = 5, and that even in this case it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum number of guesses required to guarantee discovering the secret word. We also present results regarding its parameterized complexity and offer some related open problems.},

Often, said goodies come in different types, varying by color or design, and organizers need to decide how many goodies of each type to buy. We study the problem of buying optimal amounts of each type under a simple model of preferences by the attendees: they are indifferent to the types but want to be able to choose between more than one type of goodies at the time of their arrival. The indifference of attendees suggests that the optimal policy is to buy roughly equal amounts for every goodie type. Despite how intuitive this conjecture sounds, we show that this simple model of assortment optimization is quite rich, and even though we make progress towards proving the conjecture (e.g., we succeed when the number of goodie types is 2 or 3), the general case with K types remains open. We also present asymptotic results and computer simulations, and finally, to motivate further progress, we offer a reward of $100usd for a full proof. },

Our focus is a discrete geometry problem: What is \$\${\textbackslash}mu \_\{5\}(n)\$\${$\mu$}5(n), the minimum number of convex pentagons induced by n points in the plane? In the first stage toward tackling this problem, automated reasoning tools guide discovery and conjectures: we use SAT-based tools to find abstract configurations of points that would induce few pentagons. Afterward, we use Operations Research tools to find and visualize realizations of these configurations in the plane, if they exist. Mathematical thought and intuition are still vital parts of the process for turning the obtained visualizations into general constructions. A surprisingly simple upper bound follows from our constructions: \$\${\textbackslash}mu \_\{5\}(n) {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}left( \{{\textbackslash}begin\{array\}\{c\}{\textbackslash}lfloor n/2 {\textbackslash}rfloor {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash} 5{\textbackslash}end\{array\}\}{\textbackslash}right) + {\textbackslash}left( \{{\textbackslash}begin\{array\}\{c\}{\textbackslash}lceil n/2 {\textbackslash}rceil {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash} 5{\textbackslash}end\{array\}\}{\textbackslash}right) \$\${$\mu$}5(n){$\leq\lfloor$}n/2{$\rfloor$}5+{$\lceil$}n/2{$\rceil$}5, and we conjecture it is optimal. In the second stage, we turn our focus to verifying this conjecture. Using MaxSAT, we confirm that \$\${\textbackslash}mu \_5(n)\$\${$\mu$}5(n)matches the conjectured values for \$\$n {\textbackslash}le 16\$\$n{$\leq$}16, thereby improving both the existing lower and upper bounds for \$\$n {\textbackslash}in [12, 16]\$\$n{$\in$}[12,16]. Our MaxSAT results rely on two mathematical theorems with pen-and-paper proofs, highlighting once again the rich interplay between automated and traditional mathematics.},

      abstract={Erd\Hos and Guy (1973) initiated a line of research studying $\mu_k(n)$, the minimum number of convex $k$-gons one can obtain by placing $n$ points in the plane without any three of them being collinear. Asymptotically, the limits $c_k := \lim_{n\to \infty} \mu_k(n)/\binom{n}{k}$ exist for all $k$, and are strictly positive due to the Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres theorem.
This article focuses on the case $k=5$, where $c_5$ was known to be between $0.0608516$ and $0.0625$ (Goaoc et al. 2018, Subercaseaux et al. 2023). The lower bound was obtained through the Flag Algebra method of Razborov (2007), using semi-definite programming. 
In this article we prove a more modest lower bound of $\frac{5\sqrt{5}-11}{4} \approx 0.04508$ without any computation; we exploit \emph{``planar-point equations''}  that count, in different ways, the number of convex pentagons (or other geometric objects) in a point placement.  To derive our lower bound we combine such equations by viewing them from a statistical perspective, which we believe can be fruitful for other related problems.},

Our approach takes the usage of SAT solvers in discrete geometry further by directly embedding rotational symmetry into the combinatorial encoding of geometric configurations. Then, to realize concrete point sets corresponding to abstract designs provided by a SAT solver, we introduce a novel local-search realizability solver, which shows excellent practical performance despite the intrinsic \$\$\textbackslash exists \textbackslash mathbb \textbraceleft R\textbraceright\$\${$\exists$}R-completeness of the problem. Leveraging this combined approach, we provide symmetric extremal solutions to the Erd\H os-Szekeres problem, as well as a minimal odd-sized solution with 21 points for the everywhere-unbalanced-points problem, improving on the previously known 23-point configuration. The imposed symmetries yield more aesthetically appealing solutions, enhancing human interpretability, and simultaneously offer computational benefits by significantly reducing the number of variables required to encode discrete geometric problems.},

While several computational approaches have been proposed, including SAT, randomized algorithms, and decision diagrams, none has been able to perform at scale. We argue that existing SAT encodings are hindered by the presence of global constraints (e.g., graph connectivity or acyclicity), which are generally hard to encode effectively and hard for solvers to reason about. In this work, we propose a new SAT-based approach that replaces these global constraints with simple local constraints that have substantially better propagation properties. Our approach dramatically improves the scalability of both computing and enumerating common box unfoldings: (i) while previous approaches could only find common unfoldings of two boxes up to area 88, ours easily scales beyond 150, and (ii) while previous approaches were only able to enumerate common unfoldings up to area 30, ours scales up to 60. This allows us to rule out 46, 54, and 58 as the smallest areas allowing a common unfolding of three boxes, thereby refuting a conjecture of Xu et al. (2017).},

  abstract = {Despite the wide use of k-Nearest Neighbors as classification models, their explainability properties remain poorly understood from a theoretical perspective. While nearest neighbors classifiers offer interpretability from a ''data perspective'', in which the classification of an input vector x is explained by identifying the vectors v1, ..., vk in the training set that determine the classification of x, we argue that such explanations can be impractical in high-dimensional applications, where each vector has hundreds or thousands of features and it is not clear what their relative importance is. Hence, we focus on understanding nearest neighbor classifications through a ''feature perspective'', in which the goal is to identify how the values of the features in x affect its classification. Concretely, we study abductive explanations such as ''minimum sufficient reasons'', which correspond to sets of features in x that are enough to guarantee its classification, and counterfactual explanations based on the minimum distance feature changes one would have to perform in x to change its classification. We present a detailed landscape of positive and negative complexity results for counterfactual and abductive explanations, distinguishing between discrete and continuous feature spaces, and considering the impact of the choice of distance function involved. Finally, we show that despite some negative complexity results, Integer Quadratic Programming and SAT solving allow for computing explanations in practice.},
